  question: Why chat support rather than call centre?
  answer: |-
    1. Price. Not just the price on your end, but also on your customer's side.<br />
    2. Many foreign customers prefer chat support services because of their ability to break through the language barrier more easily compared to listening<br /> 
    3. "What is written is not forgotten" - Your clients will receive instructions in written form and therefore will be able to follow instructions better.

  question: Why to have outsourced operators rather than my own?
  answer: |-
    Depending on type of your business our operators will be able to reach 60-90 %
    of your own employers'
    knowledge about your services. However
    there is much more to know to provide professional online support. Our operators are highly trained to assure your web visitors feel comfortable and
    safe on your web. Lastly, let's not forget the price that we are able to offer you operators for.
