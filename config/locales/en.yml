  about_us_text: "After years of experience with providing chat support services as outsourced operators we realized this service could be available for many other websites that are not able to afford their own chat support department. There are many companies that offer chat support applications. However none of them offer outsourced operators that will actually do full chat support on your web. We offer you a simple way to improve your web service and sales without worrying about premises prices, operator's wages, operator's trainings, software costs, software maintenance, ... . We were founded in 2010 however all of our recent personal has years of experience with providing chat-support internationally or is supervised by senior supporter who has."
